Your goal is to create a oui ui component in `registry/components/ui`.

You will be given the filename of the component in the format `oui-*.tsx`. Ask for it if not given.

Documentation to the React Aria Component to base the component on will be provided in your context. Ask for it if not provided.

The filename of the shadcn ui component on which to base the styles on will be provided. Ask for it if not given.

React Aria Components are headless and unstyled. You will need to combine the React Aria component with the shadcn ui component to create a styled and accessible component. Anaylze the existing oui components in `registry/default/ui/oui-*.tsx` to understand the patterns, conventions, and best practices for creating oui ui components.
