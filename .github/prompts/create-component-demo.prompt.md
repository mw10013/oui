Your goal is to create a oui demo component in `registry/components`.

You will be given the filename of the component in the format `oui-*.tsx`. Ask for it if not given.

Analyze the existing oui demo components in `registry/components/oui-*demo*.tsx` (EXCLUDING any filenames containing `-ex`) to understand the patterns, conventions, and best practices for creating oui demo components.
